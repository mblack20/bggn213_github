# Class 12 pt.Â 2: Population analysis
Morgan Black (PID A14904860)

## Class 12 Section 4: Population scale analysis

``` r
expr <- read.table("rs8067378_ENSG00000172057.6.txt")
nrow(expr)
```

    [1] 462

### Q13: Determine the sample size for each genotype and their corresponding median expression levels for each of these genotypes

``` r
#How many data points are there for each genotype?
table(expr$geno)
```


    A/A A/G G/G 
    108 233 121 

``` r
#What's the median expression level for each of these genotypes?

#For the A/A genotype:
AA_geno <- subset(expr, geno == "A/A")
median(AA_geno$exp)
```

    [1] 31.24847

``` r
#For the A/G genotype:
AG_geno <- subset(expr, geno == "A/G")
median(AG_geno$exp)
```

    [1] 25.06486

``` r
#For the G/G genotype:
GG_geno <- subset(expr, geno == "G/G")
median(GG_geno$exp)
```

    [1] 20.07363

### Q14: Generate a boxplot with a box per genotype, what could you infer from the relative expression value between A/A and G/G displayed in this plot? Does the SNP effect the expression of ORMDL3?

``` r
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(expr) + aes(geno, exp, fill=geno) +
  geom_boxplot(notch=TRUE)
```

![](class12pt2_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png)

The relative expression levels are much lower in the G/G genotype than
in the A/A genotype, showing that the G/G SNP clearly has an effect on
ORMLD3 gene expression by leading to much lower expression in this
population.
